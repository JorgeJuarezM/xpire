# XPIRE â€“ eXtended PYthon Interpreter for Retro Emulation

## Basic implementation of an Intel 8080 Emulator

Right now, the emulator is able to run simple 8080 binary programs. I will work on more complex features later.

For future releases, i expect to emulate another CPU / Machines and make this project extensible enough to handle this.
